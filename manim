Animation Using Manim
This repository will contain code examples and projects demonstrating the creation of mathematical animations using the Manim library. Manim, short for "Mathematical Animation Engine," is a powerful Python library developed by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) for programmatically creating precise animations, primarily for educational videos.

Project Description
This project aims to explore various animation techniques and concepts using Manim. It will serve as a personal playground for learning Manim, creating visual explanations of mathematical concepts, and potentially generating engaging video content.

Features
Manim offers a wide range of functionalities, and this project will likely showcase:

Creating Mobjects: Representing mathematical objects like points, lines, circles, polygons, text, and equations.

Transformations: Animating objects changing their position, rotation, scale, color, and more.

Scene Management: Structuring animations into logical scenes and managing their flow.

Equations: Rendering beautiful LaTeX equations.

Graphs and Plots: Visualizing data and functions.

Custom Animations: Developing unique animation sequences.

Integration with Video: Generating high-quality video files from scripts.

Installation
To get started with Manim, you'll need Python (3.7 or higher) and follow the Manim installation instructions. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

Install Python: If you don't have Python, download it from python.org.

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate


Install Manim:

pip install manim


Note: Manim also requires LaTeX and FFmpeg for full functionality. Refer to the official Manim documentation for detailed installation instructions for your operating system: Manim Community Documentation

Usage
Once Manim is installed, you can run a Manim script from your terminal.

Navigate to your project directory:

cd /path/to/your/project


Run a Manim scene:

manim -pql <your_script_name>.py <YourSceneClassName>


-p: Plays the animation after rendering.

-q l: Renders in low quality (for quick previews). Use m for medium, h for high, k for 4K.

Replace <your_script_name>.py with the name of your Python file (e.g., my_animations.py).

Replace <YourSceneClassName> with the name of the Manim Scene class you want to render from that file.

Example:

manim -pql my_first_animation.py SquareToCircle
